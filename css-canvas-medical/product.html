        <p>
          Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across clinicians,
          staff, and patients themselves &mdash; making you more productive, less stressed,
          and adding just a bit more joy into your practice of medicine.

            You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or bounce around
            five windows to discover the last blood count. Canvas pulls everything
            you need directly into your note, so you never have to leave it. And because
            Canvas learns from every interaction, it gets smarter with every patient you see.

            Canvas makes it simple to search for and take action across your entire
            patient panel, so you know who needs extra help and how to best give it
            to them. Easily reach out to any subgroup of your population with proactive
            interventions, and take comfort in knowing you're a step ahead.

          <p>
            Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you understand performance,
            but they aren't enough to improve quality and increase revenue day after day.
            Canvas automates quality protocols and charge capture so clinicians can
            focus on more complex work only they can do.

            "with MIPS a reality and fee-for-service billing rules as complex as ever,
            to be honest I didn't know how we were going to keep up. We're a small
            practice and we don't have a big quality team or a group of coders to catch
            everything. The automation in Canvas has completely eliminated my concerns
            around quality and revenue performance."
