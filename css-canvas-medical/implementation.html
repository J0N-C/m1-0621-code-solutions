                Making the Decision To Switch
              </h4>
              <p>
               You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined
               that we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched return
               on investment. Our goal is to give you as much information as possible
               to make this determiniation one way or the other. We will provide access
               to a sandbox of the Canvas application for you to get a feel for the
               platform as well as references to current customers to talk about
               their experience.

                Interfaces and Community Integration
              </h4>
              <p>
                Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and community
                resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax number,
                enrolling your payers with our clearinghouse, and getting bidirectional
                lab feeds running. We'll also load your preferred specialists and imaging
                centers into Canvas so that sending referrals and closing loops is seamless.
                Finally, if interfaces with health information exchanges or other information
                technology vendors are important, we will work with you to determine what we
                can deliver and when.

                Data Migration
              </h4>
              <p>
                The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your current
                data, which we have executed successfully with both remotely hosted and on-premise
                EMR databases. Then our work begins to import into Canvas. Patient
                demographics and information like medication, problems, and allergies is
                relatively straightforward. While importing clinical notes and documents
                is more challenging, our team has been able to do this at a high level
                of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.

              </h4>
              <p>
                We will work with you to configure Canvas property, including clinical
                content, charge checules, and much more. Role-based trainings will be
                done a few weeks prior to go-live to familiarize relevant team members
                with clinical, practice management, and billing workflows. Either before
                or during go-live, one of our team can visit your practice to work side-by-side
                with you on implementation and training.

              <p>
                Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice. We
                will be with you, either in-person or remotely depending on your preference, to
                make sure everything goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once
                you have a handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing
                clinical microtemplates, setting up new automations, modifying practice
                management settings, and more. We are here to help with it all.

              <p>
                All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises and
                provide support over the long term. Our Performance Warranty means that if
                we are not meeting expectactions, you can terminate the agreement and
                receive all payments back. (We do not expect this to happen). For our
                Standard plans, we also offer a MIPS guarantee: if you receive a negative
                adjustment, we will cover it. And for everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7
                support at no charge. We expect this to be a long, productive partnership for us both.
