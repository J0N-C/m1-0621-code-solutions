            What We Believe
          </h3>
            <p class="listmargin">
              Why did we enter this crowded field? Because medical records have fallen
              dramatically short of their promise to improve the quality and efficiency
              of health care. Clinicians spend far too long at their computers. Workflows
              are overly restrictive. Valuable medical data is left unstructured. <br>
              <br>
              We are honored, and humbled, when a practice chooses us as their technology
              partner. Medicine is a delicate craft that mixes art and science &mdash;
              technology can help or hinder this craft. Working with clinicians across
              the country, we think we have begun to build something that helps.

          Our Story
        </h3>
        <p class="listmargin">
          Andrew founded Canvas in 2015 after years of seeing his wife Anna &mdash; a family
          nurse practitioner &mdash; sacrifice family time in the evenings to "finish" charting.
          It never ended <br>
          <br>
          Andrew knew that the answer wasn't to go out and do it alone. He started to fill
          the gaps in his experience. Seven practicing clinicians formed the clinical
          advistory board &mdash; rather than leave practice to work full-time with Canvas,
          they used and reviewed product changes in their practices. Our Medical Director,
          Dr. Zimmerman, joined when he saw the potential of Canvas to help independent
          practics like his practice, Temescal Creek Medicine in Oakland CA. Julian joined
          Canvas after working at Medicare and seeing the failures of current technology
          to keep up with increasing regulatory demands without burdening clinicians.
          Joe and a world class gorup of software developers joined to accelerate our ability
          to listen to clinician feedback and constantly improve the product. <br>
          <br>
          With Canvas, we created a fundamentally different way of charting that completely
          eliminted the need for menus and pop-ups. The name of the company describes the
          charting experience &mdash; it feels like a blank canvas where you can tell the
          patient's story and seamlessly complete notes, orders, and chart review on a single,
          unified screen. With seamlessly integrated population health, billing, and practice
          management, Canvas is a reimagined platform for the modern primary care practice.
